    <p class="bodyp">Scout is a 1 1/2 year old black short-haired house cat. She is a "hemingway cat," meaning she has an extra toe or "thumb" on every paw. Keeping with the literary theme, she was named "Scout" after the character in <i> To Kill A Mockingbird.</i> Learn more about this exceptionally friendly and fun cat on this webpage.</p>

    <p class="bodyp3">Scout was adopted from a local resident but has gotten her veterinary work done through the Rochester Community Animal Clinic. They offer low-cost services to the Rochester comunity and are a great resource. Be sure to adopt from local shelters which are full of cats in need of homes.</p>
