    <h1 class="h1b">Bio</h1>
    <p class="bodyp2">Scout was born in June of 2016 and adopted by me and my roomate in June 2017. She is a black and white domestic cat with short hair and extra toes on each foot. She is a small cat for a full grown one, weighing only 6 pounds when we got her and roughly 8 pounds now. Her meow is very high-pitched and she enjoys using it to communicate a LOT. She behaves like many would say a traditionl "dog" behaves; she greets you at the door, begs for food constantly, craves attention and is excited to see everyone that crosses her path. Though we rescued her from a bad situation, she has never let that dampen her mood (even when we got her fixed and she had to wear a cone for a week) and she even has managed to befriend our much older and much grumpier cat, Ella.</p>
